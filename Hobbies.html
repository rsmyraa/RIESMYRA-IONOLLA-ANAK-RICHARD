<dt><big><b><u>Cooking</u></b></big>
<p><dd>I like to cook and prepare foods for my family and loved one. This is one of the ways for me to show my love for them and to let them know that they are special in my life.

<dt><big><b><u>Hangout</u></b></big>
<p><dd>I love to hangout with my friends during weekend. I really enjoying my days with them as that is how I release my stress after a long tiring day during weekdays. We frequently go window shopping and food seeking since eating may make us happy. Not only that, we also love to sing in the car all along the way while driving.

<dt><big><b><u>Travelling</u></b></big>
<p><dd>I really love travelling because I want to explore new things at a new place such as to try all the different dishes of every country. I would like to create as many unforgettable memories as I can for myself.
