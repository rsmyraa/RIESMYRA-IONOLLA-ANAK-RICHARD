<p>Being one among the top students in both primary and secondary school, I managed to get <b>2A 3B in UPSR</b>. When I was Form 3, I managed to get <b>7A 1B for my PT3's result</b>. I get more than what I have expected during the time. During SPM, I was able to achieve my target which is <b>2A+ 5A 1B</b>.<br><br>

Besides that, I have also managed to graduate on time during my diploma with a flying color result. I am so glad that I able to get a <big><b>Dean List for every semester with a CGPA of 3.70</b></big>. Come along with the excellent diploma's CGPA, I am also one of the <b><big>Vice-Chancellor Award's student</big></b>.</p>
